# Webfront

## Overview
Webfront is a simple web frontend project designed to demonstrate the basics of creating a web application using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. The project serves a single page that displays a welcome message.

## Features
- Lightweight and easy to understand
- Simple routing with Flask
- Runs on a local server

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Flask library

## Installation
To get started with the Webfront project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webfront.git
   cd webfront
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

## Running the Application
To run the application, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will start a development server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open this URL in your web browser, and you should see the welcome message.

## Usage
Once the server is running, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser to view the application.
